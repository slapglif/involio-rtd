.. py:class:: ModelMixin

   Bases: :py:obj:`Base`

   Generic Mixin Model to provide helper functions that all Model classes need

   .. py:attribute:: __abstract__
      :annotation: = True

      

   .. py:method:: get_or_create(cls: ModelType, *_, **kwargs) -> ModelType
      :classmethod:

      The get_or_create function is a helper function that will either get an object or create it if it doesn't exist.
      For example, let's say we have a model called User with two fields: username and email.
      We want to be able to easily create new users based on their username and email address, but we also
      want our API endpoints (and other parts of our code) to check whether a user already exists before creating them.

      :param cls:ModelType: Used to Specify the model class that will be used to create or retrieve an instance.
      :param *_: Used to Ignore the first positional argument.
      :param **kwargs: Used to Pass in all the fields of the model.
      :return: A tuple containing the object and a boolean value indicating whether it was created.


   .. py:method:: map_to_model(cls, model: Type[pydantic.BaseModel], db_response: Union[sqlalchemy.engine.Row, List[sqlalchemy.engine.Row]])
      :classmethod:

      The map_to_model function takes a model and a list of tuples,
      and returns the same list of tuples with each tuple converted into an instance
      of the given model. For example:

          map_to_model(User, [('user-id', 'username'), ('user-id2', 'username2')])
          # Returns [User(user_id='user-id', username='username'), User(...)]

      :param model:Type[BaseModel]: Used to Specify the model that is used to create a list of instances.
      :param db_response:Union[Row: Used to Determine if the db_response is a list of keyed tuples or just one.
      :param List[Row]]: Used to Check if the db_response is a list of keyed tuples.
      :return: An instance of the model class with properties mapped to value from the db_response.


   .. py:method:: rebuild(cls, kwargs: dict) -> dict
      :classmethod:

      The rebuild function takes a dictionary of data and returns a new dictionary
      with the following changes:
          - The created_at field is set to the current time.
          - If an id value is not provided, one will be generated.

          Args:
              kwargs (dict): A dictionary of data to rebuild into a model instance.

          Returns:
              dict: A rebuilt model instance with all fields updated and any missing ids added.

      :param kwargs:dict: Used to Pass in the dictionary of arguments that is being passed into the function.
      :return: A dictionary.


   .. py:method:: build_filters(cls, kwargs: dict, constraints: list = None) -> dict
      :classmethod:

      The build_filters function takes a dictionary of keyword arguments and returns a dictionary of
      filters that can be used to query the database. The returned filters are constrained by the
      keyword arguments passed in, which are also used as the keys for the returned filters. If no
      constraints are provided, all keyword arguments will be used as constraints.

      :param kwargs:dict: Used to Pass in the dictionary of parameters that we want to filter on.
      :param constraints:list=None: Used to Specify which constraints to apply.
      :return: A dictionary of filters.


   .. py:method:: get_filters(cls, context: pydantic.BaseModel = None, kwargs: dict = None)
      :classmethod:

      The get_filters function is a helper function that takes in the context and kwargs
      and returns a dictionary of filters. The get_filters function is used by all the
      endpoints to filter their results.

      :param context:BaseModel=None: Used to Pass the context of the request.
      :param kwargs:dict=None: Used to Pass in any additional keyword arguments that are passed into the function.
      :return: A dictionary of filters.


   .. py:method:: get_owner_context(cls, request: starlette.requests.Request, context: pydantic.BaseModel) -> Tuple[sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.UUID, dict]
      :classmethod:

      The get_owner_context function accepts a request and context object as arguments.
      It returns the owner_id of the user making the request, and a dictionary containing
      the values from the context object that are not None or empty strings.

      :param request:Request: Used to Get the user id of the current logged-in user.
      :param context:BaseModel: Used to Get the fields of the model that are not none or empty strings.
      :return: The owner_id of the user making the request, and a dictionary containing.


   .. py:method:: get_kwarg_dependencies(cls, kwargs)
      :classmethod:

      The get_kwarg_dependencies function takes a dictionary of keyword arguments and removes any keyword
      arguments that do not contain an _id field, which is the default requirement of any user identity object.

      :param kwargs: Used to Store the arguments passed to a function.
      :return: A list of the dependencies for a given kwarg.


   .. py:method:: get_id_args(cls, *_, **kwargs)
      :staticmethod:


   .. py:method:: get_constraints(kwargs, constraints: List[str])
      :staticmethod:


   .. py:method:: build_response(cls: ModelType = None, object_data: Any = None, error: str = None, overload: dict = None) -> dict
      :classmethod:

      The build_response function takes a list of database objects and returns a dictionary with the following structure:

      "success": True, or False if no data was returned from the database.
      "<Model Name>": [<database object>] The actual data that was returned from the database.        :param overload: custom dictionary to overload the response with
      :param error: Custom Error message if any
      :param object_data: Optional data to include in the response
      :param cls: Used to Access variables that belongs to the class.
      :return: A dictionary with a key of success and the data.
